% cenário, problema, 
  The ongoing implementation of the Internet of Things (\iot) is sharply
  increasing the number and variety of small devices on edge networks.  
%   break to 2-3 lines
  Likewise, the attack opportunities for hostile agents also
  increases, requiring more effort from network administrators and strategies
  to detect and react to those threats.
  % 
  % One such tool are the Network Intrusion Detection Systems (\nids)
  % which captures and analyses network traffic,
  % acting when a known attack or a new pattern is detected.
  For a network security system to operate in the context of edge and
  \iot, it has to comply with processing, storage, and energy
  requirements alongside traditional requirements for stream and network
  analysis like accuracy and scalability.
  % 
  Using a previously defined architecture (\arch), we address the construction
  and evaluation of a support mechanism for distributed Network Intrusion
  Detection Systems (\nids) based on the \minas Data Stream Novelty Detection
  (\nd) algorithm.

  We discuss the algorithm steps, how it can be deployed in a distributed
  environment, the impacts on the accuracy and evaluate performance and
  scalability using a cluster of constrained devices commonly found in \iot
  scenarios.

  % We found an increase of \textit{A 0.0} processed network flow descriptors per

  % Also \textit{B 0.0\%} and \textit{C 0.0\%} change in

  % limited to \textit{0.0 z MB/s} respectively.
  % Results show a negligible loss of accuracy (hits) between original, serial and

  % however efficient distribution was not achieved as the observed time as we

  The obtained results show a negligible accuracy loss in the distributed
  version but also a small reduction in the execution time using low profile
  devices. Although not efficient, the parallel version showed to be viable as
  the proposed granularity provides equivalent accuracy and viable response times.
