  The ongoing implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) is sharply increasing the 
  %small devices count 
  number and variety of small devices on edge networks and, following this increase, the
  attack opportunities for hostile agents also increases, requiring more from
  the network administrator role and the need for tools to detect and react to those
  threats.
  % 
  One such tool are the Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) %where 
  which captures and analyses network traffic, %is captured and analysed raising alarms 
  acting when a known attack or a new pattern is detected.
  For a network security tool to operate in the context of edge and
  IoT it has to comply with processing time, storage space and energy
  requirements alongside traditional requirements for stream and network
  analysis like accuracy and scalability.
  % 
  This work addresses the construction %details
  and evaluation of a prototype
  distributed IDS using %MINAS
  a Novelty Detection (ND) algorithm.
  %following up the 
  Using a previously defined %IDSA-IoT
  architecture~\cite{Cassales2019a}, 
  we discuss the algorithm steps, how it can be deployed in a distributed environment,
  the impacts on the accuracy of the ND %MINAS
  and evaluate its performance and scalability
  using a cluster of constrained devices commonly found in IoT scenarios.
  % 
  We found an increase of \textit{A 0.0} processed network flow descriptors per core
  added to the cluster. Also \textit{B 0.0\%} and \textit{C 0.0\%} change in
  \textit{F1Score} in the tested datasets when stream was unlimited in speed and
  limited to \textit{0.0 z MB/s} respectively.
