%Amid of \iot expansion in multiple fields, from industry to daily life, the constant threat of intrusion
% , subversion (overthrow), denial of service (or any other unexpected detrimental behavior)
% by any component of a system or external actors is a prospect looming over many systems administrators and for that reason
% Thus,  new network surveillance tools are needed, especially effective (accurate) and efficient (fast reaction and good throughput) \nids.
% Following that reasoning, new \nids and other autonomous and analytic system
% surveillance tools are being proposed, many employing techniques such as Anomaly
% and Novelty Detection.
% These tools require the network packet traffic to be constantly analysed,

% Este apresenta uma proposta de implementação distribuida do MINAS que segue as diretrizes da arquitetura IDSA-IoT, atendendo aos seguintes requisitos:
% (i) a etapa de classificação de vários fluxos deve ocorrer em paralelo, sendo processada em diversos locais físicos da arquitetura 
% (ii) a etapa de detecção de novidades (evolução do modelo) deve ocorrer em paralelo, sendo processada em diversos locais físicos da arquitetura 
% (iii)  as duas etapas anteriores, por sua vez também deverão ser executadas paralelamente, podendo ocorrer em partes distintas do sistema
% (iv) possa ser implementada em dispositivos com recursos limitados

In this work, we investigate an appropriate architecture for performing \nd at
the edge, as a means of allowing small IoT devices to filter and detect undesirable
network behavior.
Our approach is based on the \arch architecture \cite{Cassales2019a} and \nd
techniques provide by the \minas algorithm \cite{Faria2016minas}.
Named \mfog, our distributed algorithm explores load balancing to enable low
profile devices at the edge of the internet to also work on the classification
and detection of unwanted traffic.

% In this work we propose and assess MFOG, a distributed data stream
% novelty detection system based on the algorithm MINAS for securing IoT networks.
% MFOG implements a distributed version of MINAS according to the IDSA-IoT
% architecture proposed in a previous work [ ], to execute in the edge where small
% devices and constrained resources may be prevalent

In this work, we propose and assess \mfog, a distributed data stream
novelty detection system based on the algorithm \minas for securing \iot networks.
\mfog implements a distributed version of \minas according to the \arch
architecture proposed in a previous work \cite{Cassales2019a}, to execute in the
edge where small devices and constrained resources may be prevalent.

% In this work we investigate the application of the \arch architecture
% \cite{Cassales2019a} with \nd techniques by use of \minas algorithm
% \cite{Faria2016minas}, by implementation and evaluation of a parallel and
% distributed descendant of those two works we named \mfog.
However, given the distributed nature and the typical use of small computing
devices in IoT scenarios, new challenges arise:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\emph{\roman*})]
  \item the classification phase of the algorithm must occur in parallel at
  different nodes;
  \item the novelty detection phase, which provides the model evolution, must
  also be asynchronous;
  \item the algorithm complexity (time and space) must allow it to be processed
  by modest computing devices (i.e., small memory and low processor performance).
\end{enumerate*}

% \todo{Relembrar ids-iot, fase offline e online}
% Thus we propose a \nids using MINAS \cite{Faria2016minas}
% % (a Novelty Detection algorithm)
% to effectively identify previous and new intrusion threats,
% implemented by following the  architecture \cite{Cassales2019a} using parallel and distributed techniques leveraging
% edge and cloud for efficient computing.

% Hermes:
% O foco é detecção de intrusão ou detecção de novidade? Não sei se ND consegue de
% fato detectar intrusão e acho que esse é um terreno pantanoso.
% Se quiser citar a vasta literatura sobre IDS tudo bem, mas falar de IDS dentro
% da proposta pode dar uma ideia errada sobre a proposta.
% Sugestão:
% Our objective is to detect novel and emerging patterns in the network traffic
% and possible misbehavior (e.g., novel and emerging misbehavior that cannot be
% detected by misuse-based IDS systems) ....
\nids 
monitor network traffic, and analyze the characteristics of each flow 
% aggregated into flow descriptors and further processed in a classification
% analyze 
to identify any intrusion or misbehavior.
% using methods such as classification and Novelty Detection
% This requirement in turn, requesting more computing power at the edge.
% While requesting more computing power in a cloud environment is trivial and
% inexpensive, the same cannot be said 
However, this problem requires both fast and accurate response \cite{DaCosta2019a}:
fast response is needed to have a proper reaction before harm can be cast
to the network and to cope with the traffic without imposing loss or delay
in the \nids or observed network;
accurate response is required as not to misidentify,
% harmless with harmful and vice-versa,
especially the case of false positive that leads to false alarms.
To achieve those goals, we leverage fog computing.

% \hl{intro/related?}

In common \iot scenarios, data is captured by small devices and sent to the
cloud for any compute or storage tasks, but this is not feasible in a \nids
scenario.
% Even though we also capture data produced in the edge, sending this data to the
% cloud would in the worst case double the internet communication requirements of
% the overall system.
Fog computing infrastructure aims to offload processing from the cloud
providers by placing edge devices closer to end-users and/or data sources.
% But two \minas steps limit this fog offload, the processing intensive novelty
% detection and, long term model storage and distribution of the internal model.
% Those steps surpass the capabilities of common fog hardware and therefore need
% to be at least shared to a cloud where such requirements are easy and cheap to
% fulfill.

% \todo{[end] intro/related?}

In our proposal, fog and cloud computing resources are combined to minimize
the time elapsed between a flow descriptor ingestion and intrusion alarm,

performing the classification step of \minas  running multiple
classifier instances.
After the initial classification, the resulting label can be used immediately,
but if the sample is labeled as \emph{unknown}, this sample must be stored and
the novelty detection step will be triggered.
% , and those steps require more
% resources and thus are divided in fog and cloud.

% Therefore, our objective is a Distributed novelty detection in streams using limited hardware.

To have a better overview of our proposal and how it integrates with existing
\iot environments, Figure \ref{fig:mfog-phy-arch-cloud} depicts such scenario
showing from bottom to top:
\iot devices directly connected to a (local) gateway network;
this gateway network could be as simple as a single Internet router 
or be more complex by connecting to private clouds or 
containing more devices providing fog computing capabilities;
lastly, available over the internet, the traditional public cloud provides
inexpensive computing and storage on demand.

In this scenario, the further apart resources are, the more network
resources need to be employed, and, as with any networked system, the
higher is the latency.

% The overall organization of components, connections and interactions with external
% actors is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mfog-phy-arch-cloud},
% from bottom left to top right: sensor network; fog containing gateway router
% and novelty detection cluster; cloud storage for model, alarms and statistics
% and; human supervisor addressing alarms and statistics.

% While our proposal focuses on fog computing resources, those resources are often limited
% and they do not have the same reach and availability as traditional public cloud.
% For that reason we also leverage the public cloud for model storage and distribution,
% global novelty detection and alarm forwarding.

% \todo{Needs review}
% Source Module provides the input data stream for Offline and Online phases of \minas
% and is deployed in cloud and in fog for each respective phase and a variant for
% testing on our experiments.
% Model Store is another trivial module handling the initial Model storage and distribution
% for Classification and Novelty Detection modules.
% Last of the auxiliary modules is the Sink module, it denotes the consumer of labeling
% output stream such as an alarm system, however in our implementation it is much more
% complex, handling all tests metrics extraction and evaluations for our experiments,
% aggregating all output (stream and logs) in files for proper analysis and later comparisons.
% This module also differs in its software stack from the C language and MPI library,
% for the ease of implementing such analysis needed by our experiments, 
% courtesy of Pandas and NumPy libraries, we employed Python for this module.


% Training Module encapsulates the Offline phase of \minas and its output, being the
% initial model, is stored by the Model Store.

The overall \mfog architecture has two main modules, Classification and Novelty
Detection, which implement the \minas main tasks.
The Classification Module performs the same task of the \minas Online phase and
is the focal point for parallelism and distribution in our proposal.
It is replicated in the fog and runs on each cluster node, using a configurable
number of threads (limited to the node CPU core count).
% with one or more nodes and each node multiple processes (limited to the individual CPU core count).

The Novelty Detection Module can also be replicated,
the choice being one instance per local network, one global cloud instance,
or both.
This module also handles the homonymous task of \minas Online phase, receiving
all the samples labeled with \emph{unknown}, storing them in an internal
\emph{unknown-buffer}, and, when this buffer is full, performing the \minas
Novelty Detection task (clustering followed by validation).

% In Figure \ref{fig:mfog-architecture} we depict each logical component associated
% with each \minas step and its communications, we also depict extra modules for sampling
% and measurements.
% Each communication in Figure \ref{fig:mfog-architecture} shows the direction of the data flow
% and identifies the data contained:
% $Model$ is \minas internal Model containing a set of cluster data structures,
% $x,c$ identifies a sample with the real class,
% $x$ is the sample without the real class,
% $x,l$ identifies a sample with the assigned label,
% $x,u$ is  sample with the \emph{unknown} label,
% $summary$ is a statistical summary of model usage.

\subsection{Policies}\label{sec:policies}

% achei confuso o uso de "opens data distribution..."
The design of our distributed \nd architecture includes partitioning the
functionalities of \minas and establishing the appropriate data flows
between different actors.
Changes to placement and behavior can have different impacts and should be
chosen with care.
% The distribution of steps and tasks in various modules opens data distribution
% and its impacts to discussion.
% 
% acho que falta deixar claro o que quer comparar...
% 
The decisions following these discussions can be organized in several policies,
some of them were recurring during our implementation discussions and are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Regarding the allocation of the Novelty Detection Module:
  \begin{itemize}
    
    \item At each fog node: patterns will be only detected if sufficient samples
    of them occur in the local observed network, use of the local node
    processing power, and a model synchronization mechanism between networks
    must be added;

    \item In the cloud: detect patterns even when scattered on each local
    network, each sample with \emph{unknown} label must be sent from edge to
    cloud implying increased internet link usage and increased delay between the
    appearance of a pattern, its detection and propagation to fog classifiers;

    \item On both: local \emph{unknown} buffer is maintained and novelty
    detection is local as well, once a sample is considered as noise or outlier
    it shall be sent to the cloud where the process repeats but with global
    data.
    This choice needs an even more complex model synchronization mechanism.

  \end{itemize}
    
  \item Regarding the model cleanup (forget mechanism): Even when a global
  novelty detection is used, local models can be optimized for faster
  classification using the local model statistics by sorting by (or removing)
  least used clusters;

  \item Lastly, reclassification of \emph{unknowns}: In the novelty detection
  task in \minas, the \emph{unknown} sample buffer is effectively classified
  using the new set of clusters.
  In Algorithm \ref{alg:MINAS-nd}, at the line \ref{alg:MINAS-nd:reclassify}, the
  new cluster valid (novelty or extension) includes the set of samples composing
  that cluster, thus, if this new label assignment was put forth to the system
  output it would introduce delayed outputs, more recent and perhaps more
  accurate.
  Also, it would change the system data stream behavior from a \emph{map}
  (meaning each input has one output) to a \emph{flatMap} (each input can have
  many outputs).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}

The original MINAS algorithm has a companion implementation\footnote{Available
at \url{http://www.facom.ufu.br/~elaine/MINAS}.} (\refminas) written in Java
using MOA library base algorithms such as K-means and CluStream, but our
implementation only used K-means.
% \refminas employs Java's double, a $64 bits$ number whose precision is not
% absolutely necessary and, as it is often necessary to shuffle between nodes via
% network and a small economy could be made with only a float number with $32 bits$.
Another difference between \refminas and \mfog is the calculus of the cluster radius 
from the distances of elements forming the cluster and the cluster's center.
\refminas uses the maximum distance while \mfog uses the standard deviation
of all distances as described in \cite{Faria2016minas}.

% Desafios de implementação:
% <!--
% - Definição de raio: desvio padrão das distâncias versus distancia máxima;
% - Atualização do micro-cluster limita-se à atualização do atributo \texttt{T};
% - Remoção de exemplos na implementação de referência é feita somente para o algoritmo \textit{CluStream};
% - Inclusão de borda: algoritmo inclui ($<=$), referência não inclui ($<$);
% - Seguiu-se as mesmas divergências anteriores para comparação dos resultados com a implementação referência;
% - Inclusão da borda;
% - Comportamento do mecânismo de \textit{sleep-model} não está definido, portanto não está ativo;
% - Processo de clusterização é limitado ao algoritmo \textit{K-Means}. Algoritmo \textit{CluStream} não está implementado;
% - -->
% - `Double vs Float`:
%   - Na implementação de referência, java double é utilizado;
%   - Na nova implementação duas versões foram testadas e a diferença de precisão entre as duas é de `5 E-8`;
%   - **Solução:** Use `float32` e economize os bits já que haverá comunicação entre nós e módulos;
% - Formato do fluxo de saída:
%   - Implementação de referência utiliza a tripla `(id, classe, etiqueta)`;
%   - Primeira implementação em C utiliza `(id, clusterLabel, clusterId, clusterRadius, label, distance, secondDistance)`;
%   - Segunda implementação utiliza dupla `(id, label)`;
%   - Na etapa de avaliação, independente de versão, o fluxo original é lido;
%   - **Solução:** O formato mínimo é `(id, label)`;

\newcommand{\val}{$\vec{v}\,$\xspace}
The stream formats for input and output are also of note.
% <<<<<<< HEAD
% Input information needed is the sample value (\val),
% it being sequence of real numbers with length $d$ (dimension).
% In addition to \val, for evaluation and training purposes the class
% identifier as single character, and unique item identifier
% (\emph{uid}) can be provided or be the sample index in the stream.
% For output information and format the decision isn't so clear as we can't
% predict future system integrations needs.
% Some systems may require only novelty alarms (the minimal useful output),
% % or samples with label in a subset of all labels,
% other systems may require every sample with label and original \val.
% For the assessment in this work, \mfog outputs only enough information for
% evaluation with the full data set, meaning the format can be defined as a tuple
% containing \emph{uid} and assigned label.
% =======
As input, the algorithm takes samples (\val), which are a sequence of numbers
with dimension $d$.
In addition to \val, for both training and evaluation, the class
identifier is provided as a single character, along with a unique item identifier
(\emph{uid}), which can otherwise be determined from the sample index in the stream.

% muito longo, difícil de entender... - helio
% For output information and format the decision isn't so clear as we can't
% predict future system integrations needs like only novelty alarms or every
% samples original \val with assigned label so, we have a compromise and put only
% enough information for the Sink Module (where the full information from the
% testing file or stream can be accessed) meaning the format can be defined as a
% tuple containing \emph{uid} and assigned label.
As its output, the algorithm returns the original sample \val followed by the
assigned label. Adjustments can easily be made to provide the output results as
a tuple containing \emph{uid} and the assigned label.

% - Reprocessamento dos exemplos utilizados para atualização do modelo:
%   - Muda o comportamento do operador de fluxo de `Map` para `Flatmap`, ou seja,
%     requer outro fluxo de saída para a transmissão de padrões novidade (alarmes);
%   - Para reclassificação a definição de raio é modificada de `r = f * σ` (fator
%     multiplicando desvio padrão) para `r = max(distance)` (distância máxima);
%   - Passível da crítica de *overfitting*. Isto é, este processo pode
%     inflar a métrica de precisão;
%   - **Solução:** *em aberto*;

% Another implementation decision related to the output stream is whether or not
% to reprocess, and add to the output stream, examples in the unknown buffer after
% the novelty detection procedure, meaning one item can be classified once as
% unknown and again with a label.
% Our preliminary tests using this technique had increased true positives when compared to
% not using it.
% However this changes the stream operator behavior from a \textit{Map} to a
% \textit{FlatMap} having duplicate entries on the output stream as previously
% mentioned.
% Regardless of choice the classification of the unknown buffer after a model
% update, using the full model or just the added set of clusters, is done to
% remove the examples ``consumed'' in the creation of a new cluster in the internals
% of the clustering algorithm.
% This removal can be made less complex if using only new clusters 

% Próximos desafios:

For evaluation purposes, an \mfog implementation\footnote{Available at
\url{https://github.com/luis-puhl/minas-flink}.} was made using MPI (\emph{Open
MPI 4.0.4}).
The program is organized in a single program multiple data (SPMD)
programming model, so a single version of the \mfog program was initiated on all
nodes, being that one of them would perform the root role, while the others ran
as leaves, the program entry point is illustrated on Algorithm \ref{alg:MFOG}.
On the root process, a sampler thread is responsible for distributing the
sampled flow information (\val) to the classifier nodes, using a round-robin
load balancing scheme.
The other thread on the root process is responsible for receiving the
classification results and for processing the unknown samples in the search for
novelties.
The root process functions are illustrated in Algorithm \ref{alg:MFOG-root}.
Each leaf node runs a model adjustment thread and multiple (up to the number of
cores) classifier threads. The leaf tasks are illustrated in Algorithm
\ref{alg:MFOG-leaf}.
