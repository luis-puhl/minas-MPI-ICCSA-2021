  abstract="Data stream mining is an emergent research area that aims at
  extracting knowledge from large amounts of continuously generated data.
  Novelty detection (ND) is a classification task that assesses if one or a set
  of examples differ significantly from the previously seen examples. This is an
  important task for data stream,as new concepts may appear,disappear or
  evolve over time. Most of the works found in the ND literature presents it as
  a binary classification task. In several data stream real life problems,ND
  must be treated as a multiclass task,in which,the known concept is composed
  by one or more classes and different new classes may appear. This work
  proposes MINAS,an algorithm for ND in data streams. MINAS deals with ND as a
  multiclass task. In the initial training phase,MINAS builds a decision model
  based on a labeled data set. In the online phase,new examples are classified
  using this model,or marked as unknown. Groups of unknown examples can be used
  later to create valid novelty patterns (NP),which are added to the current
  model. The decision model is updated as new data come over the stream in order
  to reflect changes in the known classes and allow the addition of NP. This
  work also presents a set of experiments carried out comparing MINAS and the
  main novelty detection algorithms found in the literature,using artificial
  and real data sets. The experimental results show the potential of the
  proposed algorithm.",

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) allows large amounts and variety of
  devices to connect,interact and exchange data. The IoT network creates
  numerous opportunities for novel attacks that can compromise information and
  systems integrity. Intrusion detection systems have been studied over two
  decades,mostly employing traditional data mining and machine learning
  techniques that require an offline phase for model training on large amounts
  of data. This paper presents three data stream novelty detection techniques
  applied to the intrusion detection problem and proposes IDSA-IoT,a novel
  implementation architecture,which combines the use of resources at the edge
  of the network and a public cloud. After an extensive empirical evaluation,
  results show that it is possible to identify new attack patterns soon after
  their emergence and to adapt the models in an efficient way.},

  abstract="Existing machine learning solutions for network-based intrusion detection cannot maintain their reliability over time when facing high-speed networks and evolving attacks. In this paper,we propose BigFlow,an approach capable of processing evolving network traffic while being scalable to large packet rates. BigFlow employs a verification method that checks if the classifier outcome is valid in order to provide reliability. If a suspicious packet is found,an expert may help BigFlow to incrementally change the classification model. Experiments with BigFlow,over a network traffic dataset spanning a full year,demonstrate that it can maintain high accuracy over time. It requires as little as 4% of storage and between 0.05% and 4% of training time,compared with other approaches. BigFlow is scalable,coping with a 10-Gbps network bandwidth in a 40-core cluster commodity hardware."

  abstract = {The late detection of security threats causes a significant
  increase in the risk of irreparable damages, disabling any defense attempt. As
  a consequence, fast real-time threat detection is mandatory for security
  guarantees. In addition, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) provides new
  opportunities for efficient and low-cost security solutions. We propose a fast
  and efficient threat detection system based on stream processing and machine
  learning algorithms. The main contributions of this work are i) a novel
  monitoring threat detection system based on stream processing; ii) two
  datasets, first a dataset of synthetic security data containing both
  legitimate and malicious traffic, and the second, a week of real traffic of a
  telecommunications operator in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; iii) a data
  pre-processing algorithm, a normalizing algorithm and an algorithm for fast
  feature selection based on the correlation between variables; iv) a
  virtualized network function in an open-source platform for providing a
  real-time threat detection service; v) near-optimal placement of sensors
  through a proposed heuristic for strategically positioning sensors in the
  network infrastructure, with a minimum number of sensors; and, finally, vi) a
  greedy algorithm that allocates on demand a sequence of virtual network
  functions.},

  abstract        = {With the rapid evolution and proliferation of botnets, large-scale cyber attacks such as DDoS, spam emails are also becoming more and more dangerous and serious cyber threats. Because of this, network based security technologies such as Network based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs), firewalls have received remarkable attention to defend our crucial computer systems, networks and sensitive information from attackers on the Internet. In particular, there has been much effort towards high-performance NIDSs based on data mining and machine learning techniques. However, there is a fatal problem in that the existing evaluation dataset, called KDD Cup 99' dataset, cannot reflect current network situations and the latest attack trends. This is because it was generated by simulation over a virtual network more than 10 years ago. To the best of our knowledge, there is no alternative evaluation dataset. In this paper, we present a new evaluation dataset, called Kyoto 2006+, built on the 3 years of real traffic data (Nov. 2006 âˆ¼ Aug. 2009) which are obtained from diverse types of honeypots. Kyoto 2006+ dataset will greatly contribute to IDS researchers in obtaining more practical, useful and accurate evaluation results. Furthermore, we provide detailed analysis results of honeypot data and share our experiences so that security researchers are able to get insights into the trends of latest cyber attacks and the Internet situations.

  abstract        = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. Data stream mining is an emergent research area that investigates knowledge extraction from large amounts of continuously generated data, produced by non-stationary distribution. Novelty detection, the ability to identify new or previously unknown situations, is a useful ability for learning systems, especially when dealing with data streams, where concepts may appear, disappear, or evolve over time. There are several studies currently investigating the application of novelty detection techniques in data streams. However, there is no consensus regarding how to evaluate the performance of these techniques. In this study, we propose a new evaluation methodology for multiclass novelty detection in data streams able to deal with: i) unsupervised learning, which generates novelty patterns without an association with the true classes, where one class may be composed of a novelty set, ii) confusion matrix that increases over time, iii) confusion matrix with a column representing unknown examples, i.e., those not explained by the model, and iv) representation of the evaluation measures over time. We propose a new methodology to associate the novelty patterns detected by the algorithm, in an unsupervised fashion, with the true classes. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology through the use of known novelty detection algorithms with artificial and real data sets.},

abstract = {In the world scenario, concerns with security and privacy regarding computer networks are always increasing. Computer security has become a necessity due to the proliferation of information technologies in everyday life. The increase in the number of Internet accesses and the emergence of new technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT paradigm, are accompanied by new and modern attempts to invade computer systems and networks. Companies are increasingly investing in studies to optimize the detection of these attacks. Institutions are selecting intelligent techniques to test and verify by comparing the best rates of accuracy. This research, therefore, focuses on rigorous state-of-the-art literature on Machine Learning Techniques applied in Internet-of-Things and Intrusion Detection for computer network security. The work aims, therefore, recent and in-depth research of relevant works that deal with several intelligent techniques and their applied intrusion detection architectures in computer networks with emphasis on the Internet of Things and machine learning. More than 95 works on the subject were surveyed, spanning across different themes related to security issues in IoT environments.},
